      <p>
        We are a group of four undergraduates in our Third Year and this is our
        first app/project in the MERN stack under the guidance of Mr.Richie
        Arnold. This has been a great part of our learning curve, and we are
        confident that we can reach even greater success and progress as a team
        and as individuals and we will continue to work on this even after the
        end of this course.
